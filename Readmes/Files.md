# Files

`SwiftKit` contains a set of `File` utilities that simplifies working with files:

* `FileFinder` is a protocol that can be implemented by classes that can find files in various ways.
* `BundleFileFinder` checks for files in a certain bundle.
* `FileDirectoryService` is a protocol that can be implemented by classes that can manage files in a certain directory.
* `StandardFileDirectoryService` is a standard implementation of `FileDirectoryService`.
