# Bundle

`SwiftKit` contains tools for getting information from the current `Bundle`.

* `BundleInformation` is a protocol that describes a bundle.
* `Bundle+BundleInformation` implements `BundleInformation` for a certain `Bundle`.

This makes it easier to work with extraction version number, build number etc.
