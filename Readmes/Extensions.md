# Extension

`SwiftKit` contains additional logic in the form of extensions to native `Swift` types.

Since this namespace will probably grow much and fast, extensions are not listed or described here. Instead, have a look at the source code to see what kind of extensions this library contains. They should all be pretty well documented.
