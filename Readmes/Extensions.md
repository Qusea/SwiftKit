# Extension

`SwiftKit` contains a bunch of extensions to native `Swift` types, e.g. `Date`.

Most extensions are kept in the `Extensions` namespace, but some are kept in more specific namespaces, e.g. `Date`. 

Since this library will contain many extensions, most are not listed or demonstrated here or in the demo. Instead, have a look at the source code, which should be pretty well documented.
