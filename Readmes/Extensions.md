# Extension

`SwiftKit` contains extensions to native `Swift` types, e.g. `Date`.

Since this namespace will probably grow much and fast, individual extensions are not listed or demonstrated here. Instead, have a look at the source code to see what kind of extensions this library contains. They should all be pretty well documented.
