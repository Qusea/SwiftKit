/**
 This protocol can be implemented by services that can cache
 an authentication result, to avoid having to perform a real
 authentication operation if a successful authentication has
 already been performed.
 
 For instance, you can reduce the number of times users have
 to perform biometric authentication to access critical data.
 
 Note that you can't rely on a cached authentication service
 to clear its cached state. Call `resetUserAuthentication()`
 or `resetUserAuthentication(for:)` as soon as this state is
 considered to be invalid, e.g. when your app is send to the
 background and a new user can open the app at a later time.
